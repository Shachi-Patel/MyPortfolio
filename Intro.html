                    <p>In this project we developed a voice control robot which can act according to our command.
                        The whole project was developed with the help of MATLAB. The aim of the project is to explore the MATLAB in the field of artificial intelligence and to develop the robot which can work efficiently on voice command which can help to make the workforce easy in fields like industries , defence etc.</p>

                    <h2>GRAIN SPOILAGE DETECTION SYSTEM RECOGNITION - AKTU INNOVATION CEL</h2>
                    <p>It is the system to detect the spoilage of food grain and give information via web or through sms.
                        This project basically used in FCI godams, where large amounts of grain are stored and spoilage should not be detected easily by manual process. For the detection of spoilage in grains we use gas sensor, humidity sensor etc</p>
